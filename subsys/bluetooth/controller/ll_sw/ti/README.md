# SimpleLink BLE for Zephyr

This directory contains a semi-functional implementation of the Zephyr BLE Split-Stack API for the [CC1352R1 LaunchXL](http://www.ti.com/tool/LAUNCHXL-CC1352R1). 

## Build Instructions

### Prerequisites

* Ubuntu / Bionic (Linux)
* x86_64 (supported by Zephyr) / arm64 (works with a small effort)

### Getting Started with Zephyr 

Follow the instructions [here](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/getting_started/index.html)
to get your build environment set up for Zephyr.

### Persistent Environment Variables

For a convenient and persistent way to store and modify environment variables
for each build, add the following to your `${HOME}/.zephyrrc` file.

```bash
export ZEPHYR_TOOLCHAIN_VARIANT=zephyr
export ZEPHYR_SDK_INSTALL_DIR=~/zephyr-sdk-0.11.2
export BOARD=cc1352r1_launchxl
export ZEPHYR_PROJECT=samples/bluetooth/peripheral_hr
```

### Check Out the simplelink-ble-for-zephyr Branch

Add the `cfriedt` remote and pull the sources

```bash
cd zephyrproject/zephyr
git remote add cfriedt https://github.com/cfriedt/zephyr.git
git fetch cfriedt && git checkout -b simplelink-ble-for-zephyr \
	cfriedt/simplelink-ble-for-zephyr
```

### Build the `peripheral_hr` demo

```bash
source zephyr-env.sh
west build $ZEPHYR_PROJECT
```

If you ever encounter errors in the build phase, you can always delete the
`build` directory or use `west build -p always`.

You may also browse project configuration using `ninja -C build menuconfig`.

### Open a terminal

```bash
minicom ttyACM0
```

### Flash the `peripheral_hr` demo to your CC1352R1 LaunchXL  

```bash
$ west flash
-- west flash: rebuilding
ninja: no work to do.
-- west flash: using runner openocd
-- runners.openocd: Flashing file: /home/cfriedt/workspace/zephyrproject/zephyr/build/zephyr/zephyr.hex

After flashing is complete, you should see the following terminal output in minicom:

Open up a BLE-compatible device and attempt to pair to the CC1352R1 LaunchXL.
You should see `Zephyr Heartrate Sensor`.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cfriedt/zephyr/simplelink-ble-for-zephyr/subsys/bluetooth/controller/ll_sw/ti/pairing.png" width="200">

Once you attempt to pair with the device, there will be [a lot of diagnostic
logs](https://github.com/cfriedt/zephyr/raw/simplelink-ble-for-zephyr/subsys/bluetooth/controller/ll_sw/ti/ti.txt) output to the terminal.

## Debugging with an Oscilloscope

If you have an oscilloscope handy, you can use pins 30, 5, 23, and 24 to
observe TX, RX, ISR, and BLE TX Window events, respectively.

The screenshot below captured some BLE advertisement packets being exchanged.

## Current State of the Port

The PR has been open for a long time and is updated periodically.

https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/pull/21631

Simple advertisement is working. CONNECT_IND is received but there seems to be a timeout for subsequent messages.

Additional debug info from the CMD_BLE_SLAVE is available [here](https://github.com/cfriedt/zephyr/raw/simplelink-ble-for-zephyr/subsys/bluetooth/controller/ll_sw/ti/cmd-ble-slave.txt).

There is also another branch with a brief attempt to use several independent
radio event handlers instead of a single ISR. However, that branch is not currently
rebased on Zephyr's master.
